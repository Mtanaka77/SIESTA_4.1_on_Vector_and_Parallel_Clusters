# SIESTA_on_PC

  The SIESTA code is implemented for electronic structure calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics 
simulations of molecules and solids by spanish group https://departments.icmab.es/. It is usually compiled  
for parallel MPI environment, but also is done for Intel's vectorized compiler. We would like to show
how the siesta-4.1 code is compiled.
